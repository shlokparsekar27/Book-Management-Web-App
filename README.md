## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed

### Installation

To get the project up and running on your Mac:

1.  **Open Terminal:** You can find Terminal in `Applications/Utilities/` or by searching with Spotlight (Command + Space and type "Terminal").

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd ~/Documents/Projects`). Then, run the following command to clone the project from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shlokparsekar27/Book-Management-Web-App.git](https://github.com/shlokparsekar27/Book-Management-Web-App.git)
    ```

3.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Change into the frontend directory of the cloned project:

    ```bash
    cd Book-Management-Web-App/bookworm-frontend
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:** Install all the required project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the Development Server:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the local development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will typically open the application in your default web browser at an address like `http://localhost:5173` (the exact port might vary).
